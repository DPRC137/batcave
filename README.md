# BatLine Terminal

This project provides a browser-based terminal styled after Batman's command line. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to interact with **BatLine**. Type `help` to see the available commands or simply start asking Batman questions.

The terminal supports command autocompletion with the Tab key and lets you chain commands with `&&` or `;`. It can also connect to OpenAI to answer queries in Batman's voice. Set your API key in `env.js`.
